# join_em

A new Flutter project.
 Our team CODESBYGOATS is creating Join'Em, a one-stop solution for hosting events and gatherings. We are making the hosting process as easy as possible by integrating participants, hosts and sponsors at the same place. Hosts can create, manage and execute the smallest of the tasks from the app. We have integrated AI features like budget tracking, host support chatbots, customer support chatbots, ranking of events and recommendation systems. Sponsors can look fo events and sponsor them which cater their needs and provide a relevant target audience. 
 
 Here is a detailed working :
 Our platform reshapes event management for hosts, participants and even sponsors by going beyond simple event discovery and registrations. Instead of making societies depend on several different tools, it provides a single workspace for managing the entire event lifecycle. Hosts can add and manage co-hosts and volunteers, track budgets, monitor participants, and create detailed to-do lists where tasks are assigned, tracked, and completed by specific team members in real time. Most event platforms do not offer these features. Our mission is to bring all the components required during event hosting at a single place and remove the hassle of switching to multiple platforms.

For users, the app serves as more than just a browsing portal; it is a smart discovery system. They can explore events with complete transparency, form or join teams, and receive personalized event recommendations. A machine learning-based ranking engine prioritizes events according to user interests and behavior, ensuring that relevant events gain visibility instead of random listings.

Sponsors are also well integrated into the ecosystem. They can search for events that match their brand goals and connect directly with hosting units, which eliminates the usual challenges in sponsorship outreach. Organizers can also run in-app ads to increase event visibility, creating a sustainable way to make money while supporting communities, organizers, and sponsors on a single platform.
